# LDA-Coherence-Scores
Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be a powerful tool in identifying semantic groups in vast unstructured textual data like discharge notes. One of the ways to evaluate the degree to which learned topics are meaningful and interpretable is to calculate the Coherence Score under varying ranges of the model hyperparameters. 

In this case, Coherence scores have been calculated and visualzed for different combinations of key hyperparamters from topic modeling of clinical text. The results can be used for
-Further tuning of hyperparameters.
-Checking model performance under varying rules of text pre-processing. 
-Validation of top topics, their distribution per note, and distribution of words associated with each topic. 

Please note that due to human subject research rules, the MIMIC-III cannot be publicly provided. I invite you to review the enclosed code and slides to familiarize yourself with the project.
